        <h2>i do a bit of everything</h2>
        <p>
          But in everything I do, I search for a bit of the <em>why</em> in the world.  <br> <br>
          I'm a spectator, a detective, a researcher, a coder, a mathematician, and a lifetime student. <br> <br>
          I'm a philosopher. I'm a <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> addict. I'm an adrenaline junkie.
          I'm chasing the good vibes; I'm learning from the bad ones. I'm years of experience. And I will be more things yet to come.

        <h3>You can find my relevant docs here: <a href="portfolio/Resumes/current.pdf">resume</a> | <a href="portfolio/Transcripts/current.pdf">transcript</a> | <a href="https://github.com/elliottyoon">github</a> </h3>
        <h3>If you have some extra time to spare, here's the story behind my resume:</h3>
        <p>
          My story starts in the summer before Grade 6, when I spent my precious hours of freedom <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/elliottyoon/">ripping off other people's Javascript programs on Khanacademy</a>.
          This was my first introduction to programming, and though I largely stopped coding for many years after, the wonderous experience of building tangible applications never left my mind. 
          It was during this hiatus, however, that I discovered my love for mathematics — the concept of imaginary numbers particularly piqued my interest. <br><br>
          In freshman year, this interest in math led me to taking all my high school classes at a local community college, where I was offered a Lab Assistant job by my General Chemistry professor.
          This was my first real job, and it was here where I learned to work independently — safely performing neutralization reactions by myself — as well as work with my coworkers, learning to optimize team efficiency when the dreaded end-of-semester-drawer-cleaning season rolled around.
          <br>
          <br>
          Five semesters, three calculus classes, and one differential equations class later, I began working as a math tutor at my college. 
          It was through tutoring that I developed my ability to communicate my mathematical intuitions to others in layman's terms. (As the great Albert Einstein once said, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yourself"!)
          <br><br>
          However, there still were many things I couldn't explain at all, and in my senior year of high school, I enrolled at Case Western Reserve University, taking introductory Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra.
          It was here where I also learned to object-oriented programming in Java — which in conjunction to exploring number theory in Jupyter notebooks — reignited my love for computer science.
          Since then, I've been dipping my toes in all things computer science, with projects ranging from websites like this to neural networks from scratch. 
          <br><br>In the beginning of March 2021, I enrolled in a <a href="https://c1-web.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment?utm_source=email&utm_medium=university_group&utm_campaign=university_group6">Data Science bootcamp</a> taught by Harvard University's Natesh Pillai in order to build data proficiency.
          The field of predictive analytics fascinates me, and I can't get enough of it, from completing the quintessential <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/SMTLG2SQ6VAV">Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng</a> to creating <a href="https://github.com/elliottyoon/Linear-Regression">explanatory Jupyter notebooks building linear regression models from scratch</a>.

        <h2>what next?</h2>
        <p>
          
          I'll be starting a new journey, moving to Chicago to study math and computer science at Northwestern University in the fall of 2021. 
          I don't know what the future has in store for me, but whatever it is, I can't wait for it!
